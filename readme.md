# Soduku - December 2025 Challenge

Solve a soduku board (3x3 quads of 3x3) as fast as you can

## What is Soduku

Sudoku is a logic-based number puzzle played on a 9x9 grid, which is also divided into nine 3x3 blocks. The goal is to fill the grid with the numbers 1 through 9 so that each number appears only once in every row, column, and 3x3 block. It is a game of logic and deduction, not guessing

## Rules

1. A horitonal and vertical line cannot contain more than one instance of a number [1..9] at any time
2. A quad (a collection of 3x3) cannot contain more than one instance of a number [1..9] at any time
3. The game ends when all spaces contain numbers [1..9]

## Solver

1. You must create a "solver" than resolves the board (without modifying the original board code) - using the supplied "solver.rs"
